# World_Weather_Analysis
##Overview 
 This repository uses an OpenWeather API, Google Maps and Directions API, in addition to using the Citipy module as well as numerous other modules and packages.
We used all those tolls to generate 2000 random coordinates and find the nearest cities and hotels to them depending on the weather specifications of the user.
